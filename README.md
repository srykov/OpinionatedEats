# Opinionated Eats - Restaurant Reviews App

This was a project that I developed as part of my Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Program. Udacity provided code for a Restaurant Reviews application and the project required me to make it mobile-ready, accessible, and available offline.  I re-wrote the application to use Angular JS instead of vanilla javascript. The initial application structure was generated with [yo angular generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular)
version 0.16.0.

## What I Learned
This project gave me an opportunity to practice what I learned in the Front-End applications section of the course.

Specifically I practiced:
* using AngularJS
* making an application accessible
* using the ServiceWorker and Cache APIs

## Required Software

* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
* [Node/NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [Bower](http://bower.io/)
* [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/)

## Getting Set Up

* clone this repo
* `cd` into the newly cloned project
* install NPM dependencies via `npm install`
* install Bower dependencies via `bower install`

## View the app

* on the terminal, run `grunt serve`
