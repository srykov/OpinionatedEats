# Opinionated Eats - Restaurant Reviews App

This was a project that I developed as part of my Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Program. For the project I was given code for a Restaurant Reviews application and asked to make it mobile-ready, accessible, and available offline. Udacity provided some initial HTML and javascript for rendering the application. I re-wrote the application to use Angular JS. The initial application structure was generated with [yo angular generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular)
version 0.16.0.

## Build & development

Run `grunt` for building and `grunt serve` for preview.

## Testing

Running `grunt test` will run the unit tests with karma.
